# Monte Carlo Methods
## Principles
The CDF of standard norm distribution is
\begin{equation}
\Phi(t) = \int^{t}_{-\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-y^{2}/2}dy
\end{equation}
by the Monte Carlo methods
\begin{equation}
\hat{\Phi}(t)=\frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}I(X_{i}\leq t)
\end{equation}
where $X_{i}$'s are iid $N(0, 1)$ variables.

## Approximation Outcomes
The approximation is implemented at $n\in \{10^{2}, 10^{3}, 10^{4}\}$ at $t\in\{0.0, 0.67, 0.84, 1.28, 1.65, 2.32, 2.58, 3.09, 3.72\}$. The outcome table with true values is shown below.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
